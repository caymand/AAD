\begin_layout Subsection
Classes of problems
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The set of problems in 
\begin_inset Formula $P$
\end_inset

 are those that can be solved in 
\begin_inset Formula $O(n^{k})$
\end_inset

 for some constant 
\begin_inset Formula $C$
\end_inset

.
 The class of 
\begin_inset Formula $NP$
\end_inset

 are those problems that can be verified in polynomial time.
 Meaning, if a certificate of a solution is given, we can verify the validity
 of that certificate.
 NP-completeness problems concernes itself with decision problems rather
 than optimization problems.
 That is, we concern ourselves with not finding the optimal solution to
 a problem, but we would rather like to get a yes/no answer solution to
 a problem.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We can more formally define the a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

problem
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 as an abstract problem 
\begin_inset Formula $Q$
\end_inset

.
 This is a binary relation between a set of problem 
\emph on
instances
\emph default
, 
\begin_inset Formula $I$
\end_inset


\emph on
, 
\emph default
and a set 
\begin_inset Formula $S$
\end_inset

 of solutions to the the problem instance.
\begin_inset Note Note
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
make drawing here to show this is a relation not a function
\end_layout

\end_inset

 
\begin_inset Formula $S$
\end_inset

 is a set, since the solutions might not in general be unique and there
 might be more than one solution to a problem instance.
 A problem instance could for instance in the SHORTEST-PATH problem be a
 tripple 
\begin_inset Formula $(s,t,G)$
\end_inset

 (source, destination and graph), and a solution would be a sequence of
 vertices for the shortest path.
 For NPC this definition of an abstract problem is too big, since decision
 problems concern themselves with decision problems and thereby expect yes/no
 solutions.
 Therefore, in the context of NPC problems, we can relax the definition
 of an abstract definition as a function (instead of a relation) that maps
 instances 
\begin_inset Formula $I$
\end_inset

 into the solution set 
\begin_inset Formula $\{0,1\}$
\end_inset

(yes/no answers).
 With this definition, SHORTEST-PATH optimization problem can be cast into
 another problem PATH, which a decision problem, whos instances consists
 of the 4-tuple 
\begin_inset Formula $(s,t,G,k)$
\end_inset

 that asks whether there is a path from 
\begin_inset Formula $s$
\end_inset

 to 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

 in 
\begin_inset Formula $G$
\end_inset

 of length at most 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Encodings
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Since the problems actually runs on a machine, the program solving the problem
 will take an encoding of the problem instance.
 This encoding will typically be a binary string, and a problem with encoding
 as a binary string is known as a 
\series bold
\emph on
concrete problem
\series default
\emph default
.
 This means, that if an algorithm finds a solution to an instance 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

 of size 
\begin_inset Formula $n=|i|$
\end_inset

 in 
\begin_inset Formula $O(T(n))$
\end_inset

 then it solves the problem in 
\begin_inset Formula $O(T(n))$
\end_inset

 time.
 This carries over to the definition of polynomial time solvable, since
 this means that an algorithm solves a problem in 
\begin_inset Formula $O(n^{k})$
\end_inset

 if it given an problem instance with encoded size 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

 is solved in 
\begin_inset Formula $O(T(n))=O(n^{k})$
\end_inset

, and this is the class of problems 
\begin_inset Formula $P$
\end_inset

 - problems that can be solved in polynomial time proportional to their
 encoding size.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
With encodings we can therefore map the abstract problems to concrete problems.
 There are however problems with the encodings, where specific encodings
 will determine the efficiency(running time) of the algorithm.
 We shall use the encoding 
\begin_inset Formula $\langle k\rangle$
\end_inset

 to refer to any 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

concise
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 encoding of 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

.
 This means that whatever encoding is used, it is polynominally time related
 to the binary representation.
 This way, we can work in the concise representation and then always afterwards
 convert to the binary format.
 
\series bold
\emph on
Therefore, it is assumed that all problem instances are binary strings encoded
 in a concise way.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Why encodings matter
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We can have an algorithm that takes a single 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

 as input and runs in 
\begin_inset Formula $\Theta(k)$
\end_inset

 time.
 With unary encoding, meaning 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

ones, this means that the algorithm runs in 
\begin_inset Formula $O(n)$
\end_inset

 for length 
\begin_inset Formula $n=k$
\end_inset

 inputs.
 If we however use normal binary encoding, then a number of size 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

 requires 
\begin_inset Formula $\lfloor\log_{2}k\rfloor+1$
\end_inset

 bits to encode., and we instead have the input length 
\begin_inset Formula $n=\lfloor\log_{2}k\rfloor+1$
\end_inset

.
 However, the running time is still 
\begin_inset Formula $\Theta(k)$
\end_inset

, but since we now have a shorter encoding this means that 
\begin_inset Formula $k=2^{\log_{2}n}$
\end_inset

 which gives running time of 
\begin_inset Formula $\Theta(2^{n})$
\end_inset

 and we have exponential running time in the size of the input.
 Since the running time of an abstract problem depends so heavily on the
 encoding, we can in reality not talk about running time of an abstract
 problem without specifying the encoding.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Languages
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
From language theory, an alphabet 
\begin_inset Formula $\Sigma$
\end_inset

 is a finite set of symbols.
 In this setting, 
\begin_inset Formula $\Sigma=\{0,1\}$
\end_inset

.
 A language 
\begin_inset Formula $L$
\end_inset

 is any string made from an alphabet.
 The language over all strings is denoted by 
\begin_inset Formula $\Sigma^{*}$
\end_inset

.
 Decision problems, 
\begin_inset Formula $Q$
\end_inset

, are a mapping, or function, from problem instances 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

 to a 
\begin_inset Formula $\{0,1\}$
\end_inset

 solution.
 Since we encode problem instances as binary strings 
\begin_inset Formula $x\in\Sigma^{*}$
\end_inset

, and decision problems are characterized by the yes-problem instances(those
 where 
\begin_inset Formula $Q(x)=1$
\end_inset

 with all other input being 
\begin_inset Formula $0$
\end_inset

), we can view decision problems as languages over 
\begin_inset Formula $\Sigma^{*}$
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
L=\{x\in\Sigma^{*}:Q(x)=1\}
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
With the definition of decision problems as languages, we can view the decision
 problem PATH as the language
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align}
\text{PATH}=\{\langle s,t,G,k\rangle\in\Sigma^{*}: & G=(V,E)\text{is an undirected graph and}\\
 & s,t\in V\\
 & k\text{is and integer}\\
 & \text{there exists a path from \ensuremath{s\rightsquigarrow t} of at most \ensuremath{k} edges}\}
\end{align}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The language accepted by an algorithm 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

is the set of binary strings 
\begin_inset Formula $x\in\Sigma^{*}$
\end_inset

for which
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
L=\{x\in\Sigma^{*}:A(x)=1\}
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
An algorithm rejcts a string if 
\begin_inset Formula $A(x)=0$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A language 
\begin_inset Formula $L$
\end_inset

 is decided by 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 if every string in 
\begin_inset Formula $L$
\end_inset

 is accepted by 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 and all other strings are rejected.
 This leads to the definition of accepted and decided in polynomial time.
 What is important to note is perhaps that if an algorithm only accepts
 a language, then it can just halt for invalid strings, which is not allowed
 if it decides a language.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
By this we can formally define the complexity class 
\begin_inset Formula $P$
\end_inset

 as
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align}
P & =\{L\subseteq\{0,1\}^{*}:\text{there exists an algorithm \ensuremath{A}that }\\
 & \text{decides \ensuremath{L}in polynomial time}
\end{align}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
meaning all the languages that can be decided in polynomial time.
 From this follows a theorem saying that the class of problems 
\begin_inset Formula $P$
\end_inset

 are the languages that are accepted by polynomial time algorithms.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\series bold
Theorem: 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
P=\{L:L\text{ is accepted by a polynomial time algorithm}\}
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\series bold
Proof:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We can prove this by showing that 
\begin_inset Formula $P$
\end_inset

 is both an inclusive subset, 
\begin_inset Formula $\subseteq$
\end_inset

, and inclusive superset, 
\begin_inset Formula $\supseteq$
\end_inset

, of the above set.
 It is trivial to show that 
\begin_inset Formula $P$
\end_inset

 is a subset of this, since by the definition of 
\begin_inset Formula $P$
\end_inset

 being those languages that are decided, and since the languages that are
 decided in polynomial time are a subset of those that are accepted in polynomia
l time.
 This is true, since the definition of deciding meant that it accepts 
\begin_inset Formula $L$
\end_inset

 and rejects all other inputs.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Therefore, we need to show that the above set is a subset as well, meaning
 that if a language is accepted by a polynomial time algorithm 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 then it also decided by another polynomial time algorithm, say 
\begin_inset Formula $A'$
\end_inset

.
 We can prove this by simulation, and we let 
\begin_inset Formula $A'$
\end_inset

 by an algorithm that runs 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

.
 Since we know that 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 accepts a language in polynomial time, it accepts 
\begin_inset Formula $L$
\end_inset

 in at most 
\begin_inset Formula $cn^{k}$
\end_inset

 steps.
 Therfore, we can let 
\begin_inset Formula $A'$
\end_inset

 be the algorithm that simulates 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 for 
\begin_inset Formula $cn^{k}$
\end_inset

steps.
 Thereafter, it can check if 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 accepted the string, in which case 
\begin_inset Formula $A'$
\end_inset

 returns 
\begin_inset Formula $1$
\end_inset

, otherwise 
\begin_inset Formula $A'$
\end_inset

 will return 0.
 Simulating 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 induces an overhead that is no more than a polynomial factor, and therefore
 
\begin_inset Formula $A'$
\end_inset

 is still a polynomial time algorithm that can decide 
\begin_inset Formula $L$
\end_inset

, and therefore deciding a language is a superset of accepting a language
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We have now shown the set is a subset and superset of the definition, meaning
 it also belongs to the complexity class 
\begin_inset Formula $P$
\end_inset

.

The class NP

\end_layout

By this definition, then 
\begin_inset Formula $P\subseteq NP$

\begin_layout Subsection
Polynomial reducible
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A language 
\begin_inset Formula $L_{1}$
\end_inset

 is polynomial reducible to another language 
\begin_inset Formula $L_{2}$
\end_inset

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
L_{1}\le_{p}L_{2}
\]

\end_inset

\begin_layout Standard
if there exists a polynomial time computable function 
\begin_inset Formula $f:\{0,1\}^{*}\rightarrow\{0,1\}^{*}$
\end_inset

 such that for all 
\begin_inset Formula $x\in\{0,1\}^{*}$
\end_inset

we get that
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
x\in L_{1}\iff f(x)\in L_{2}
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This means that the reduction function 
\begin_inset Formula $f$
\end_inset

 provides a polynomial time mapping, such that every 
\begin_inset Formula $x\in L_{1}$
\end_inset

will be in 
\begin_inset Formula $f(x)\in L_{2}$
\end_inset

 and if 
\begin_inset Formula $x\notin L_{1}$
\end_inset

will not be in 
\begin_inset Formula $f(x)\notin L_{2}$
\end_inset

.
 The function 
\begin_inset Formula $f$
\end_inset

 maps instances 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

 of the decision problem identified by 
\begin_inset Formula $L_{2}$
\end_inset

 into instances 
\begin_inset Formula $f(x)$
\end_inset

 of the decision problem identified by language 
\begin_inset Formula $L_{2}$
\end_inset

 and solving a decision problem in either 
\begin_inset Formula $L_{2}/L_{1}$

 provides the solution to the decision problem in the other language.

 is called the

, since the decision problem of solving problem instance for the language
 
\begin_inset Formula $L_{1}$

 is reducible to solving

 in 
\begin_inset Formula $L_{2}$

 by 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

 If 1 is returned the assignment is satisfiable.
 Otherwise it is not.
 The running time of 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 is the running time of the formula.
 The running time must be polynomial in the size of the formula - number
 of connectives and boolean variables.

Showing NP-hardness
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Showing NP-hardness means we have to take circuit-sat and reduce it into
 the SAT problem.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If we have a circuit-satisfiable circuit 
\begin_inset Formula $C$
\end_inset

 then we start by assigning a variable 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{i}$
\end_inset

 to each wire of the circuit.
 Then, we can view each gate of 
\begin_inset Formula $C$
\end_inset

 as a mapping from its input wire to its output wire (there will always
 be one output wire, which might then later fan out).
 Then we simply construct a subformula 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi_{i}$
\end_inset

 for each gate in the circuit doing exactly what the gate did.
 For instance, if we have an AND gate with three input, we can express the
 output as 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{4}\iff(x_{1}\land x_{2}\land x_{3})$
\end_inset

.
 We can construct a subformula for each gate.
 To produce the formula 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi$
\end_inset

, we AND the output wire 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{m}$
\end_inset

 of 
\begin_inset Formula $C$
\end_inset

 with all the subformulas ANDed together 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi=x_{m}\land\phi_{1}\land\phi_{2}\land,...,\land\phi_{k}$
\end_inset

.
 Since we get a satisfying circuit when the output wire is 1, then this
 formula simply says that the output wire should be what we expect and that
 each gate should do what it is intended to do.
 Therefore, whenver 
\begin_inset Formula $C$
\end_inset

 is satisfiable, then 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi$
\end_inset

 is also satisfiable.
 We have now shown 
\begin_inset Formula $f$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $F$
\end_inset

 runs in polynomial time in the number of gates and wires, since we just
 assigned a variable for each wire, and then made a subformula for each
 gate.

The clique problem

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\text{CLIQUE}=\{\langle G,k\rangle:G\text{is a graph containing a clique of size }k
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The naive solution would be to consider each 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

 subset of vertices and check if it is a clique.
 This would be 
\begin_inset Formula $_{|V|}C_{k}$
\end_inset

which is 
\begin_inset Formula $\Omega(k^{2}({]V] \choose k})$
\end_inset

.
 The problem is that 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

 will often be near 
\begin_inset Formula $|V|/2$
\end_inset

 and it is therefore not polynomial.

\begin_layout Subsubsection

 has an edge in

 A formula

\begin_inset Formula $\phi=C_{1}\land C_{2}\land,...,\land C_{k}$

 Each clause consists of 3-different litterals that are ORed together.
 We will construct a graph that only has a clique of size

 if and only if 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi$

 is satisfiable.
 Note the if and only iff from the definition of the function

Showing the 3CNF-SAT implies CLIQUE

\begin_layout Standard
Suppose that 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi$
\end_inset

 is in fact a satisfying assignment.
 Then each clause 
\begin_inset Formula $C_{r}$
\end_inset

 must contain at least one literal 
\begin_inset Formula $l_{i}^{r}$
\end_inset

 that is assignment 1.
 This literal will in 
\begin_inset Formula $G$
\end_inset

 be the vertex 
\begin_inset Formula $v_{i}^{r}$
\end_inset

.
 If we from each clause pick a literal that gets assigned 1, then we will
 have 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

 vertices 
\begin_inset Formula $V'$
\end_inset

 in 
\begin_inset Formula $V$
\end_inset

.
 Now, any vertices 
\begin_inset Formula $v_{i}^{r},v_{j}^{s}\in V'$
\end_inset

 map to 
\begin_inset Formula $1$
\end_inset

 and are of different clauses (that is how we picked them).
 Furthermore since both literal 
\begin_inset Formula $l_{i}^{r},l_{j}^{s}$
\end_inset

 are 
\begin_inset Formula $1$
\end_inset

 they cannot be complements of each other - satisfying the other part of
 how we constructed 
\begin_inset Formula $G$
\end_inset

, and therefore there must be an edge between 
\begin_inset Formula $v_{i}^{r},v_{j}^{s}$
\end_inset

.
 We picked two random vertices, so this holds for all vertices.

\begin_layout Subsection
Vertex cover 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
First we suppose that 
\begin_inset Formula $G$
\end_inset

 has a clique with vertices 
\begin_inset Formula $V'\subseteq V$
\end_inset

 of size 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

.
 Then we pick any edge 
\begin_inset Formula $(u,v)\in\bar{E}$
\end_inset

.
 Since the edges in the clique will all be edges from 
\begin_inset Formula $G$
\end_inset

, and the edge 
\begin_inset Formula $(u,v)\notin E$
\end_inset

 then this means that either 
\begin_inset Formula $u$
\end_inset

 or 
\begin_inset Formula $v$
\end_inset

 or both cannot be in 
\begin_inset Formula $V'$
\end_inset

(since if both were in 
\begin_inset Formula $V'$
\end_inset

 it violates our assumption that 
\begin_inset Formula $(u,v)\in\bar{E}$
\end_inset

, since the clique only contains edges in 
\begin_inset Formula $G$
\end_inset

.
 One of them might not be in 
\begin_inset Formula $V'$
\end_inset

 also, since it could be that 
\begin_inset Formula $v$
\end_inset

 is in 
\begin_inset Formula $V'$
\end_inset

, but there is not edge from 
\begin_inset Formula $u$
\end_inset

 to 
\begin_inset Formula $v$
\end_inset

).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If we look at the set of vertices 
\begin_inset Formula $V-V'$
\end_inset

, then we know theses are the vertices that are not in the clique.
 We also know that the edges in the clique cannot be any edges in 
\begin_inset Formula $\bar{E}$
\end_inset

.
 We must remember that 
\begin_inset Formula $u,v$
\end_inset

 are still vertices in 
\begin_inset Formula $V$
\end_inset

.
 And since either one or both were not in 
\begin_inset Formula $V'$
\end_inset

, then at least one (or both) of 
\begin_inset Formula $u,v$
\end_inset

 will be in 
\begin_inset Formula $V-V'$
\end_inset

.
 Therefore we now know that the edge 
\begin_inset Formula $(u,v)$
\end_inset

 will be covered by 
\begin_inset Formula $V-V'$
\end_inset

.
 We took the edge 
\begin_inset Formula $(u,v)$
\end_inset

randomly from 
\begin_inset Formula $\bar{E}$
\end_inset

, and therefore we know that all 
\begin_inset Formula $\bar{E}$
\end_inset

 are covered by 
\begin_inset Formula $V-V'$
\end_inset

.
 We know the size of this cover set is 
\begin_inset Formula $|V|-k$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Now we need to show the other direction, so we will have to assume that
 
\begin_inset Formula $\bar{G}$
\end_inset

has a vertex cover 
\begin_inset Formula $V'$
\end_inset

 of size 
\begin_inset Formula $|V'|=|V|-k$
\end_inset

.
 If we have an edge 
\begin_inset Formula $(u,v)\in\bar{E},$
\end_inset

then we must have that 
\begin_inset Formula $u$
\end_inset

 or 
\begin_inset Formula $v$
\end_inset

 or both are in 
\begin_inset Formula $V'$
\end_inset

, since we know that 
\begin_inset Formula $\bar{G}$
\end_inset

 is covered by 
\begin_inset Formula $V'$
\end_inset

 (therefore the edges in 
\begin_inset Formula $\bar{E}$
\end_inset

 must be incident on the vertices in 
\begin_inset Formula $V'$
\end_inset

).
 This means that for all vertices 
\begin_inset Formula $u,v\in V$
\end_inset

 if 
\begin_inset Formula $u\notin V'$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $v\notin V'$
\end_inset

 then we will have that 
\begin_inset Formula $(u,v)\in E$
\end_inset

, since when both edges 
\begin_inset Formula $u,v\in V'$
\end_inset

 then they are an edge of 
\begin_inset Formula $\bar{E}$
\end_inset

(we chose that 
\begin_inset Formula $V'$
\end_inset

 was a cover of 
\begin_inset Formula $\bar{G}$
\end_inset

which has the edge set 
\begin_inset Formula $\bar{E})$
\end_inset

, and whenever the pair 
\begin_inset Formula $(u,v)$
\end_inset

are not an edge of 
\begin_inset Formula $\bar{E}$
\end_inset

they are an edge of 
\begin_inset Formula $E$
\end_inset

 (we chose 
\begin_inset Formula $\bar{E}$
\end_inset

 to be exactly all edges not in 
\begin_inset Formula $E$
