There cannot be an edge intersecting the diagonal vt since t is the edge furtherst from uw
Diagonal vt seperates u and w. Therefore we can say u is not in the bottom and w not in the top
	Hence both upper and lower has at most n-1 vertices
Remove triangle of a leaf and add it back - where we add it back the edges will have two colors, so the third edge of the added triangle can always have a ny color

Since each triangle has a distinct color, we can put a camera on any color
	- just pick the smallest number of same color
	- n = nr + ng + nb
	- so if we pick floor(n/3) we have enough
	
Two-ears theorem - triangulation is represented by dual-graph which is a tree
	- A tree always has two leaves
	
y-monotone - horizontal line intersects in connected set or not at all
	- 1-monotone would mean 1 intersection

Start-vertex, when sweeping to down we intersect new part of polygon
split - one intersection is split into 2
end - intersection with polygon dissapears
merge - intersections is merged
Seen from below merge vertices become split and the other way around
	- two seeps

Below our sweep line
	- this is a contradiction since we handle the vertices top down in the sweep line(so we would break the assumption of top down sweeping)

The helper - the vertex we want to connect to when we create a new diagonal
Ex 1: d
Ex 2: c
